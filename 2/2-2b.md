# Running a Docker Container (Basic for Beggining)

After building a Docker image, the next step is to run a container using that image. The `docker run` command is used to start a container.

## **Basic Docker Run Command**
```sh
docker run my-image
```

### **Breakdown:**
- `docker run` → Starts a new container.
- `my-image` → Name of the image to run (must be built or pulled first).

## **Running a Container in Detached Mode (`-d`)**
```sh
docker run -d my-image
```
### **Explanation:**
- `-d` (detached mode) → Runs the container in the background.
- Without `-d`, the container runs in the foreground, showing logs.
- To see running containers:
  ```sh
  docker ps
  ```
