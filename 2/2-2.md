# Dockerfile

A **Dockerfile** is a script containing a series of instructions to automate the creation of Docker images. It defines the base image, application dependencies, environment configurations, and how the containerized application should run.

## 1. **Basic Commands**

### `FROM`
- Specifies the base image for the container.
- Every Dockerfile must start with a `FROM` instruction.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu:20.04
  FROM node:16
  ```

### `RUN`
- Executes commands inside the container during the image build process.
- Used to install packages, configure settings, etc.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
  ```

### `CMD`
- Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
- Unlike `RUN`, it executes at runtime, not during the build.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["echo", "Hello, Docker!"]
  ```

### `ENTRYPOINT`
- Defines the main command for the container, making the image behave like an executable.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
  ```
- Difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`: `CMD` can be overridden by command-line arguments, whereas `ENTRYPOINT` ensures the base command is always executed.

### `COPY`
- Copies files from the local system to the container image.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
  ```

### `ADD`
- Similar to `COPY`, but can also extract compressed files and fetch remote URLs.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  ADD app.tar.gz /app/
  ```

## 2. **Environment and Configuration Commands**

### `WORKDIR`
- Sets the working directory inside the container.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR /app
  ```

### `ENV`
- Sets environment variables in the container.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  ENV NODE_ENV=production
  ```

### `EXPOSE`
- Specifies the ports the container listens on.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  EXPOSE 80
  ```
  **Note**: This does not publish the port, it just documents it.

### `USER`
- Specifies the user to run the container processes.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  USER appuser
  ```

### `HEALTHCHECK`
- Defines a command to check the containerâ€™s health.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
  ```

### `LABEL`
- Adds metadata to the image.
- Example:
  ```dockerfile
  LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"
  ```

## 3. **Multi-Stage Builds**

Multi-stage builds are used to create lightweight and optimized images by separating the build environment from the final production image. This approach reduces the image size and improves security.

### Example of a Multi-Stage Build
- This Dockerfile compiles a Go application in one stage and then copies only the compiled binary into the final production image.

  ```dockerfile
  # First stage: Build the application
  FROM golang:1.17 AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN go build -o myapp
  
  # Second stage: Create a minimal production image
  FROM alpine:latest
  WORKDIR /root/
  COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
  ENTRYPOINT ["./myapp"]
  ```

### Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds
- **Reduces Image Size**: The final image only contains the necessary runtime components.
- **Improves Security**: Removes build dependencies from the production image, reducing attack surfaces.
- **Enhances Performance**: Smaller images lead to faster deployments and better resource utilization.
